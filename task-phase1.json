{ "type": "multimedia-specialist", "description": "Phase 1: Foundation Setup - Create comprehensive frontend component architecture", "prompt": "I need you to orchestrate Phase 1 of the multimedia frontend migration. You need to:

**PHASE 1 REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Analyze the existing frontend structure in src/frontend/components/
2. Create proper directory architecture with these categories:
   - core/ (basic media components)
   - advanced/ (complex processing features)
   - interactive/ (QR codes, dynamic elements)
   - display/ (galleries, players, carousels)
   - utilities/ (upload, validation, helpers)

3. Review TypeScript configurations (tsconfig.frontend.json exists)
4. Ensure proper build system updates for frontend components
5. Verify autonomous operation requirements

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Every file MUST be under 200 lines
- NO mock data allowed
- Components must support real data sources
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Follow existing multimedia module patterns

**EXISTING COMPONENTS TO INTEGRATE:**
You have some components already:
- FileUpload.tsx, ProfilePictureUpload.tsx in src/frontend/components/
- VideoAnalyticsDashboard.tsx in src/frontend/components/video/
- PortfolioGallery.tsx, PodcastGeneration.tsx, VideoIntroduction.tsx in src/components/

**SOURCE COMPONENTS TO PREPARE FOR:**
From parent CVPlus project we'll migrate:
- PortfolioGallery, VideoIntroduction, TestimonialsCarousel, VideoAnalyticsDashboard
- PodcastGeneration, AIPodcastPlayer, PodcastPlayer
- DynamicQRCode, EnhancedQRCode, QR utilities
- FileUpload, ProfilePictureUpload, media validation

Create the foundation architecture that will properly organize all these components. Work in /Users/gklainert/Documents/cvplus/packages/multimedia directory." }
