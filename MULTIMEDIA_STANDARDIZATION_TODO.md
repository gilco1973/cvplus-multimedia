# Multimedia Submodule Standardization Progress

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### .claude Directory Structure
- [x] .claude directory exists 
- [x] settings.local.json upgraded to full processing-submodule template
- [x] commands/ subdirectory with multimedia-specific commands
- [x] agents/ subdirectory with multimedia-focused agent links

### Settings Configuration
- [x] Full processing-submodule template implemented
- [x] Multimedia-specific permissions added (ffmpeg, media tools)
- [x] Agent directory access configured
- [x] Media processing tool permissions included

## Phase 2: CLAUDE.md Comprehensive Upgrade ✅ COMPLETED

### Current State
- [x] Comprehensive multimedia CLAUDE.md created
- [x] multimedia-specialist as primary domain expert
- [x] Video/audio/image processing focus included
- [x] Integration patterns for CVPlus multimedia flow
- [x] Media processing commands and procedures

### Content Requirements
- [x] Multimedia domain expertise section
- [x] Video generation and processing capabilities
- [x] Podcast creation and audio processing
- [x] Image optimization and portfolio galleries
- [x] QR code enhancement features
- [x] Performance optimization guidance
- [x] Integration with HeyGen, RunwayML APIs

## Phase 3: Documentation Structure ✅ COMPLETED

### docs/ Directory Setup
- [x] docs/plans/ for multimedia processing plans
- [x] docs/diagrams/ for media architecture diagrams
- [x] Multimedia-specific documentation standards established

## Phase 4: Scripts Structure ✅ COMPLETED

### scripts/ Directory Setup  
- [x] scripts/build/validate-build.sh - media processing build automation
- [x] scripts/test/run-media-tests.sh - media pipeline testing
- [x] scripts/deployment/ for media service deployment
- [x] scripts/utilities/optimize-media.js - media optimization tools

## Phase 5: Validation ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Current Status: TypeScript Compilation Failures
- [x] Infrastructure setup completed
- [x] Standardization templates applied
- [❌] **CRITICAL**: 100+ TypeScript compilation errors
- [❌] **CRITICAL**: Cross-module dependency violations
- [❌] **CRITICAL**: Import path resolution failures

### Issues Requiring Resolution:
1. **Cross-module dependencies**: Imports from @cvplus/admin, payments violating independence
2. **Type mismatches**: API signature misalignments causing compilation failures
3. **Root directory violations**: Files from other packages included in compilation
4. **Import resolution**: Cannot resolve modules from other packages

### Next Steps:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix cross-module dependency violations
2. **HIGH**: Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
3. **MEDIUM**: Validate independent build capability
4. **LOW**: Performance benchmarks and final validation

**Current Status**: Standardization infrastructure complete, but critical compilation issues prevent autonomous operation. Requires immediate dependency cleanup.
